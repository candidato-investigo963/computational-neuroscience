# Project 1 – Spike-Triggered Average (STA)

## Description
This project implements a Spike-Triggered Average (STA) analysis to investigate neural encoding mechanisms. The STA is a classical technique in computational neuroscience used to estimate the linear temporal filter of a neuron by averaging the stimulus segments that precede each spike.

The dataset contains:
- A stimulus time series (`stim`)
- A binary spike train (`rho`), where 1 indicates a spike

The sampling rate of the data is 500 Hz.

## Method
- Sampling period: 2 ms (1 / 500 Hz)
- Time window: 300 ms before each spike
- Number of time steps: 150

Spikes occurring before the first 300 ms are excluded.
For each spike, the stimulus segment preceding it is extracted and averaged
across all spikes to compute the STA.

## Results
The resulting STA represents the linear receptive field of the neuron.
